## The problem
Cryptocurrency is a widely used currency used in modern days for the purpose of wealth or asset transfer between individuals due to the following properties:

1. No central point of failure
2. Transparentcy
3. Global borderless transaction
4. Anonymity of both sender and receiver

But at the same time, those features of cryptocurrency also allow scammers to easily circumvent traditional anti-scamming mechanisms.
