## Architecture
Our solution rely on a known labeled bad and good transaction address, and the publicly available bitcoin ledger as the fact source. Our system will scrape the public ledger, and by using machine learning algorithm, our system is able to generate the label for the other transactions. On a query for a wallet address, our system will label all transactions that are related to the wallet address, and the number of the good and bad transactions related to the wallet is used to compute the trust score.
