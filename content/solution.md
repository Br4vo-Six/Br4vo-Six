## Our Solution
Our proposed solution is the creation and utilization of a trust score in order to determine the suspiciousness level of a bitcoin address. The trust score is not a definitive value on the trustworthiness of the address, but rather as an early screening method to provide an early warning for the user before submitting the transfer order.
